## OAuth Consent Phishing Simulation with Microsoft Graph and User.Read Scope

---

# Platforms and Languages Leveraged

- Windows 10 Virtual Machines (Microsoft Azure)
- Microsoft Sentinel
- EDR Platform: Microsoft Defender for Endpoint
- Kusto Query Language (KQL)
- App registered in Azure Active Directory (multi-tenant)
- Python and MSAL used for token acquisition
    
---

## Scenario

This project demonstrates an OAuth consent phishing attack simulation using a multi-tenant Azure app. The goal was to simulate how an attacker can gain access to sensitive user data (without needing a password) by tricking a user into granting delegated access to a malicious application.

---

## Objective

### To simulate a realistic cloud-based attack path where a user unknowingly grants delegated access to a rogue application, allowing an attacker to:

- Read user profile information
- Persist access using refresh tokens
- Operate without detection if no user reports suspicious activity

---

## Why this is dangerous:

- Nothing looks ‚Äúsuspicious‚Äù at first
- Defender doesn‚Äôt flag login anomalies (the user consented)
- No password spray or brute-force events
- Only deep log review or a SIEM with consent detection rules (such as my KQL queries below) might catch it

---

## Attacker Accesses Data (Stealthily):

The attacker uses Mail.Read or Files.Read.All to:
- Search inboxes for invoices, passwords, business contacts
- Download sensitive files from OneDrive
- Persist access silently for months using the refresh token

No MFA prompt is triggered ‚Äî because OAuth tokens bypass that.

---

## Attack Simulation Steps

1) App Registration: Registered a multi-tenant app in Azure AD with public client flow enabled.

Redirects:

---

2) Generated Consent URL: Shared phishing-style URL to trigger consent screen. This link can be shared via email, any chat platform, etc.

Targeted phishing email like:

    ‚ÄúYour Outlook session expired. Reauthorize access now.‚Äù
    Click here to continue working securely ‚Üí [OAuth link]

0Auth link:

https://login.microsoftonline.com/common/oauth2/v2.0/authorize?
client_id=<348ed938-8c24-4cb4-8dff-1b5ed4e31778>
&response_type=code
&redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fexample.com%2Fcallback
&response_mode=query
&scope=Mail.Read offline_access User.Read
&state=attack123

---

3) Consent: User accepted the app‚Äôs request for User.Read and offline_access scopes.

Once the user clicks agree they will be redirected to a page such as this:

<img width="2034" height="1020" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/460c23ea-c15c-4dc7-af68-0417e143e171" />

---

4) Access Token Retrieval: Used MSAL in Python to perform device code login.

This Python script represents post-consent activity performed by an attacker. The victim only sees the Microsoft OAuth consent prompt in their browser. No scripts or malware are needed for this attack ‚Äî just social engineering and permission abuse.


```Python
import msal, requests

client_id = "348ed938-8c24-4cb4-8dff-1b5ed4e31778"
authority = "https://login.microsoftonline.com/common"
scopes = ["User.Read", "offline_access"]

app = msal.PublicClientApplication(client_id, authority=authority)
flow = app.initiate_device_flow(scopes=scopes)

if "user_code" not in flow:
    raise ValueError("Failed to start device code flow")

print("\nTo authenticate:")
print(flow["message"])

result = app.acquire_token_by_device_flow(flow)

if "access_token" in result:
    print("\n‚úÖ Authenticated successfully.")
    token = result["access_token"]
    r = requests.get(
        "https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/me",
        headers={"Authorization": f"Bearer {token}"}
    )
    user = r.json()
    print("\nüë§ User Info:")
    print(f"Display Name: {user.get('displayName')}")
    print(f"UPN: {user.get('userPrincipalName')}")
    print(f"ID: {user.get('id')}")
else:
    print("\n‚ùå Failed to authenticate:")
    print(result.get("error_description"))
```
---

After the above script is ran the output will be what is shown below. Allowing me access to the end user:

---
After Python script is executed the following prompts will appear 

Prompt requesting to sign into app:

<img width="1202" height="782" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c1844797-29a3-481e-9f2d-5ca6becfe20e" />

The below prompt shows the attacker now has continued access to the end users profile throuh tokens and not passwords:

---

5) API Call: Successfully queried Microsoft Graph API for the signed-in user's profile data.

6) Log Collection: Verified consent grant and app sign-ins using KQL queries in Sentinel.

## KQL Detection Queries Used

1. Consent Grant Detection

**Query used to locate events:**

```kql
AuditLogs
| where OperationName in ("Consent to application", "Add delegated permission grant")
| extend AppName = tostring(TargetResources[0].displayName)
| where AppName has "Phish" or AppName has "PhishMailReader" 
| project TimeGenerated, AppName, InitiatedBy, ActivityDisplayName, Result
```

---

2. App Sign-in Usage

```kql
SigninLogs
| where AppDisplayName has "Phish" or AppDisplayName has "PhishMailReader"
| project TimeGenerated, UserPrincipalName, AppDisplayName, IPAddress, ClientAppUsed
```

<img width="1734" height="756" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5e6b6284-6d64-47c0-ba04-95f5039398af" />

## MITRE ATT&CK Mapping

T1078.004 Initial Access - Valid Accounts (Cloud Accounts)
- The attacker gains access not by stealing passwords, but by tricking a user into consenting to a malicious Azure application. This gives the attacker a valid, delegated session token ‚Äî essentially making them a ‚Äúvalid user‚Äù in the cloud without needing credentials.

T1528 Credential Access - Access Token Manipulation
- After the victim clicks ‚ÄúAccept,‚Äù the attacker uses the MSAL Python script to request and manipulate delegated access tokens, allowing them to act on behalf of the user. The attacker may store or replay the refresh_token for persistent access.

T1550.003 Defense Evasion - Exploit Authorization Logic Flaw
- The attacker exploits Microsoft‚Äôs trust model where an approved third-party app is considered legitimate. Because the victim willingly approved access, no alerts are triggered ‚Äî even though the attacker is now operating under the user‚Äôs identity.

T1098.001 Persistence - Cloud Service Permissions
- By requesting the offline_access scope during consent, the attacker obtains a refresh_token, enabling long-term access without the user ever logging in again. 

T1071.001 Command and Control - Application Layer Protocol
- The attacker uses the Microsoft Graph API (HTTPS-based) as the command-and-control channel to communicate with Microsoft 365 and extract user data. This occurs entirely over legitimate Microsoft infrastructure, making it hard to detect.

---

## Recommendations

### Prevention

- Disable user consent to unverified applications in Entra ID settings.
- Require admin approval for apps requesting high-impact scopes (Mail.Read, Files.Read.All).
- Enable app consent policies and set trusted publisher restrictions.

---

## Detection

Deploy Sentinel analytic rules for:
- New delegated consent events
- Apps requesting offline_access, Files.Read.All, etc.
- Sign-ins from unknown app IDs

Example of rule set: 

Name: Suspicious OAuth App Consent
Description: Detects when a user grants consent to an unknown third-party OAuth app in Azure AD
Severity: Medium (or High, if targeting high-risk scopes)
Tactics: InitialAccess, CredentialAccess, Persistence, DefenseEvasion

```kql
AuditLogs
| where OperationName contains "Consent"
| extend AppName = tostring(TargetResources[0].displayName)
| where AppName !in ("Microsoft Teams", "SharePoint", "KnownGoodApp1", "Your Internal HR App")
| extend InitiatingUser = tostring(InitiatedBy.user.userPrincipalName)
| project TimeGenerated, AppName, InitiatingUser, Result
```
---

These would be used to help map the rules for proper alerting when creating the rules:

Consent to unknown app	T1078.004, T1098.001, T1550.003
Consent with risky scopes	T1528, T1098.001, T1548
Sign-in from unknown apps	T1071.001, T1528, T1098.001

---

All three rules are now enabled and active in Sentinel:

---

## Containment

Revoke access tokens using:
- Revoke-MgUserSignInSession -UserId <UPN>
For example: Revoke Access Tokens (Force Sign-Out) -> Command via Powershell: Revoke-MgUserSignInSession -UserId "victimuser@yourtenant.onmicrosoft.com"

What it does:
- Forces the user to re-authenticate
- Invalidates access + refresh tokens
- Stops token replay attacks for consented apps

---

Block sign-ins from malicious app client IDs
For example: If you know the App (Client) ID of the malicious application, you can block it using:
Method 1: Conditional Access Policy
Go to Entra ID -> Security -> Conditional Access -> Create a new policy:
        Assignments -> Cloud apps -> Include -> Select apps -> Add the malicious app (by name or ID)
        Access controls -> Block access
        Scope it to all users or only targeted users

What it does:
- This prevents any sign-in via that app, regardless of user.

---

Remove consent via: Enterprise Applications > Permissions
For example: Azure Portal -> Entra ID -> Enterprise applications -> Filter by ‚ÄúAll Applications‚Äù -> Click the malicious app -> Go to Permissions
Then: Select the user(s) under ‚ÄúUser Consent‚Äù -> Click Remove Permissions

What it does:
- This removes the consent record, so even if the attacker still has a refresh token, Microsoft will reject token use.
